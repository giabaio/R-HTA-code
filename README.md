# R for HTA code

This repository includes annotated scripts extracted by the various chapters of the book R for Health Technology Assessment, edited by Baio, Thom and Pechlivanoglou (2025). The book is publicly available in electronic format from [this website](https://gianluca.statistica.it/books/online/r-hta) and further information is available at the [book webpage](https://gianluca.statistica.it/books/r-hta/), as well as at the [publisher's website](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/edit/10.1201/9781003031819/health-technology-assessment-gianluca-baio-howard-thom-petros-pechlivanoglou).

The scripts are organised by chapters -- each is labelled in line with the book's TOC.

In each subfolder, there is an `R` file `code.R`, which contains the code used to run through the examples shown in that specific chapter. In addition, whenever suitable, there is also an additional folder `data`, which contains the datasets needed to run the examples.
